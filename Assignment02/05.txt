QUE:- What are the modules in Node.js? Explain

ANS:-   =>In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external
          application on the basis of their related functionality.
        =>Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiple files/folders.
        =>The reason programmers are heavily reliant on modules is because of their reusability as 
          well as the ability to break down a complex piece of code into manageable chunks.

        Modules are of three types:
            1.Core Modules:
                =>Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and come
                  with Node.js installation.
                =>These modules can be loaded into the program by using the required function.

            2.Local Modules:
                =>Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created
                  locally in your Node.js application.

            3.Third-party modules:
                =>Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package
                  Manager(NPM).
                =>These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally.
                =>Some of the popular third-party modules are Mongoose, express, angular, and React.
